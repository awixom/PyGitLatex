Introduction
------------

The goal of this project is to provide a simple interface
enabling collaboration between authors of a Latex document
using Git. To some extent, this is an already solved 
problem: see the excellent ShareLatex/Overleaf software.
And, further, it should be noted that PyGitLatex is **not**
a replacement for ShareLatex/Overleaf. However, for some
users (meaning the author, at least) the 
ShareLatex/Overleaf framework has a few disadvantages.
PyGitLatex aims to correct these by providing the following
features:

- Direct control of project history (i.e. git respository)
- Use of user's preferred/existing Latex toolchain
- No required cloud-based storage or computing


Installation
------------

PyGitLatex requires three main softwares to be installed 
on a user's computer, all three of which are available on 
all popular operating systems although at times under 
slightly different names.

  - Python3 interpreter with the following packages:
      + pyforms 
      + gitpython
  - Git
  - Latex

Once these have been installed, PyGitLatex may be run by
invoking the python3 interpreter on the python script in 
this repository.

At some point in the future, self installer packages may
be provided.
